Something that is important to me is my dog. Story time, he was off leash 
he ran into the road and a car almost ran by him and I screamed the f out 
of my lungs because I thought he was dead, but he was still alive I picked 
him up crying and my dad decided to call it a day and took me home bcs I 
was really upset after what happened.So yeah he means a lot to me and is 
very important to me.
